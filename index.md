Ensuring correctness in high-performance computing (HPC) applications is one of the fundamental challenges that the HPC community faces today. While significant advances in verification, testing, and debugging have been made to isolate software errors (or defects) in the context of non-HPC software, several factors make achieving correctness in HPC applications and systems much more challenging than in general systems software—growing heterogeneity (architectures with CPUs, GPUs, and special purpose accelerators), massive scale computations (very high degree of concurrency), use of combined parallel programing models (e.g., MPI+X), new scalable numerical algorithms (e.g., to leverage reduced precision in floating-point arithmetic), and aggressive compiler optimizations/transformations are some of the challenges that make correctness harder in HPC. The following report lays out the key challenges and research areas of HPC correctness: [DOE Report of the HPC Correctness Summit](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1470989).

As the complexity of future architectures, algorithms, and applications in HPC increases, the ability to fully exploit exascale systems will be limited without correctness. With the continuous use of HPC software to advance scientific and technological capabilities, novel techniques and practical tools for software correctness in HPC are invaluable.

The goal of the Correctness Workshop is to bring together researchers and developers to present and discuss novel ideas to address the problem of correctness in HPC. The workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks in this area.

### <a class="anchor" name="submissions"> Submissions and Format </a>

Authors are invited to submit manuscripts in English structured as technical or experience papers at a length of at least **6 pages** but not exceeding **8 pages** of content, including everything except references. Submissions must use the [IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

<!--Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by the Program Committee and accepted papers will be published by IEEE Xplore via TCHPC.-->
Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by the Program Committee and accepted papers will be published by IEEE Xplore.

Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other venue. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected without review. Submissions received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately structured may also not be considered. At least one author of an accepted paper must register for and attend the workshop. Authors may contact the workshop organizers for more information. Papers should be submitted electronically at: [https://submissions.supercomputing.org/](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/).

#### SC Reproducibility Initiative

We encourage authors to submit an **optional** artifact description (AD) appendix along with their paper, describing the details of their software environments and computational experiments to the extent that an independent person could replicate their results. The AD appendix is not included in the 8-page limit of the paper and should not exceed **2 pages** of content. For more details of the **SC Reproducibility Initiative** please see: [https://sc19.qltdclient.com/submit/reproducibility-initiative/](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative/).
